# mastodon-flyer-generator

A WIP template generator for helping promote Mastodon on other platforms.

The idea is that we could have a variety of designs and sample texts that appeal to different people, e.g. "Love Linux? Join linuxrocks.online"

We hope to crowdsource development, so would love help with:

* source images for the flyers
* suggested text snippets
* improving the functionality (maybe a dropdown to switch between source images?)

Let us know if you can help :)
